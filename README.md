# MaNGOS Model Viewer (M3)
An addon used to view gameobject models, find nearby gameobjects, and manipulate them.

# How to Use
Download the files. The MaNGOS_Model_Viewer directory should be placed into your Addons directory.

# Scripts
I've included a "Scripts" directory, this is NOT required for using the addon. It's a quick script that I used to build m3data.lua.

# More work to be done?
Always! If you have suggestions, please open an issue. If you have a fix/addition, please open a pull request.

Based on the work by CosminPOP for TWmv
